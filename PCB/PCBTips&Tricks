## Traces'width
Traces' width should be proportional to the current, and expected operating temperature raise.
The following link proves pretty useful and effective in doing so: https://www.4pcb.com/trace-width-calculator.html


## Distance between traces
There should be enough distanec between traces especially in HF(high frequency).


## Corner's shapes
The angles should be smoothened so as to avoid energy radiation especially in HF.


## Power condos and resistaces
Should as close as possible to the pins they are connected to.


## library making and updating
It is a primordial skill a pcb designer should have. I have personnaly followed YT tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvRGmltr_P8


## GND planes
Should be linked using vias.
Impose restrict patches on some components so as to have an easier time soldering.



## Label using in a schematic
Use labels so as to have a simplified and easy to read schematic. Instead of linking every component, use labels instead.
You basically just have have to give the same signals the same labels and let the magic operate.
